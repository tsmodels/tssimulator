\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class tsissm.component or other supported class.}

\item{frequency}{seasonal frequency.}

\item{gamma}{the decay coefficient on the error of the seasonal component}

\item{s0}{a vector of length frequency - 1 for the initial seasonal component.}

\item{init_harmonics}{number of harmonics to initialize s0 when this is not provided.}

\item{normalized_seasonality}{whether normalize the seasonal component based on the
method of Roberts and McKenzie. This is applied only to a single seasonal frequency.}

\item{init_scale}{the scaling multiplier for s0 (when this is not provided).}

\item{...}{additional parameters.}
}
\value{
An object of class tsissm.component updated with the seasonal
component.
